  "proof_sketch": "### Proof Sketch:\nThe problem requires calculating the work done by a variable force F(x) = 3*X^2 moving an object from x=0 to X. The student's knowledge base only includes constant-force formulas and dot products, but not integration or calculus concepts like integrals/derivatives (no limits). Thus:\n1.) Since the problem requires integrating a variable force over distance (`W = \u222bF(x)dx`), we cannot solve it with just this context. The student must fail because they lack prerequisite knowledge o",
